# An Interactive Simulation Game For Teaching Cell Evolution

### Synopsis:

Understanding biological evolution is challenging because it involves intricate biological processes and time periods that are incomprehensible to mankind. Several video games have made an attempt to illustrate how biological evolution works, but they did not go into enough detail about the specifics of the subject. Even now, humans still don't fully understand how cells evolve and evolved. To better explain in convenience how cell evolution operates, the researchers have developed an interactive simulator game for cell evolution. The researchers have proposed a computer system that can simulate the evolution of cells. The system is developed using a Unity Game engine as a tool for developing the game. A simulation game which focuses on different cell evolutions where the user can choose an evolutionary path  and has a dynamic environment that can simulate the harsh environment which past cells lived in long ago.
